# robotic-traveler: A coding challenge
There are two robotic travelers on a rectangle surface. And we control them via this robotic traveler app.
We send commands that surface corner, robot's location, robot's direction and robot's route pattern.

We enter five input:

1- End corner coordinat of surface(start corner is 0,0). Example: "6 8"

2- First robot's location and direction.(Only can use W-west, E-east, N-north and S-south letters for direction) Example: "2 3 E"

3- First robot's route pattern. (Only can use L,R and M letters.) Example: "LMMRMLLMM"

2- Second robot's location and direction. 

3- Second robot's route pattern. Only can use L,R and M letters.
